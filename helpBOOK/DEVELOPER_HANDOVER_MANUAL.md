## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & REPOSITORY STRUCTURE

TenderHub is a procurement intelligence platform designed to eliminate the operational overhead of searching, qualifying, and bidding for public works and government tenders in India (with primary production ingestion tailored for the NIC-GEP / `jktenders.gov.in` portal infrastructure).

The system consists of three operational software tiers:
1. `backend/`: Node.js (v20+) running Express 5, Mongoose 9, BullMQ with Redis, Playwright for portal automation, Razorpay SDK, AiSensy WhatsApp integration, and Gemini/OpenAI analytical services.
2. `frontend/`: React 19 single-page application built on Vite 8, React Router v7, Zustand 5, TanStack Query 5, and Tailwind CSS.
3. `admin-panel/`: Isolated administrative console on Vite for manual ingestion triggers, system monitoring, and database management.

```

### 3.2 End-to-End Data Lifecycle

#### Step 1: Automated Crawler Ingestion
1. The background scheduler (`backend/src/server.js` using `node-cron`) initiates crawling routines:
   - Hourly office-hours polling: checks newest published notices.
   - Evening sweep (19:00 IST): captures all late-day tenders.
   - Nightly document recovery (01:00 IST): downloads any missed NIT documents.
   - Nightly purge (03:00 IST): flags tenders past closing dates as `status: 'EXPIRED'`.
2. The crawler (`JKTenderAdapter.js`) utilizes Playwright to navigate the portal ASP.NET viewstate tables.
3. If an ASP.NET CAPTCHA appears, the image is passed to CapSolver API or solved locally.
4. Extracted fields (Tender ID, Title, Reference Number, EMD, Tender Fee, Opening Date, Closing Date, Department, Work Location) are validated against the Mongoose `Tender` schema.
5. If NIT or BOQ documents exist, they are streamed to disk, compressed with Ghostscript if oversized, and uploaded to Cloudflare R2 via presigned PUT requests. The resulting S3 keys are stored on the `Tender` document.

#### Step 2: Database Ingestion & Cache Invalidation
1. Tenders are upserted into MongoDB using `sourceTenderId` as the unique deduplication key.
2. Redis cache keys representing global statistics (`tenders:stats:all`) and page listings are invalidated to ensure fresh data delivery.
3. MongoDB text indexes on `title`, `sourceTenderId`, `tenderId`, and `tenderReferenceNumber` provide full-text search capability.

#### Step 3: Notification Dispatch (WhatsApp & Email)
1. When a new tender is inserted, the notification engine queries `ContractorPreference` records.
2. If a contractor's configured filters (e.g. Department = "Public Works", District = "Srinagar", Min Value = 10,00,000) match the tender, a job is added to the notification queue.
3. The AiSensy WhatsApp adapter formats the message template and dispatches an alert with a direct link to the tender and attached BOQ.

#### Step 4: Contractor Discovery & Interaction
1. The contractor opens `frontend` (`/tenders`).
2. Search and filter queries hit `/api/v1/tenders` with query parameters (`page`, `limit`, `search`, `department`, `status`, `minValue`, `maxValue`, `sort`).
3. Results are returned with pagination metadata.
4. The contractor can save tenders to their profile (`/api/v1/contractor/saved-tenders`) or download verified documents directly via Cloudflare R2 URLs.

#### Step 5: Checkout & Subscription Activation
1. The contractor navigates to `/pricing` or `/services` and chooses a plan.
2. The frontend calls `/api/v1/billing/create-order`. The backend creates a Razorpay Order and attaches metadata notes (`userId`, `planId`).
3. Razorpay Checkout modal opens. Upon payment completion, verification occurs in two parallel paths:
   - Synchronous Path: Frontend submits `razorpay_payment_id`, `razorpay_order_id`, and `razorpay_signature` to `/api/v1/billing/verify-payment`. The backend computes HMAC-SHA256 signature and activates the subscription.
   - Asynchronous Webhook Path: Razorpay sends a `payment.captured` or `order.paid` event to `/api/v1/billing/webhook`. The backend validates the `X-Razorpay-Signature` against `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and ensures activation even if the user closed the browser during redirect.
4. AI credits (`dossierCredits`, `chatQueries`) are credited to the contractor's profile in MongoDB.

## 5. SECURITY, BOTSHIELD, & RESILIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE

### 5.1 BotShield & Anti-Scraping Protection
Located in `backend/src/middleware/botShield.middleware.js`:
- User-Agent Inspection: Automatically blocks aggressive headless scrapers, generic Python scripts, and unauthorized scraping bots.
- Honeypot Endpoints: Hidden routes (e.g. `/wp-login.php`, `/.env`) that permanently blacklist offending IP addresses in Redis upon access.
- IP Blacklisting: Instant IP lookup in Redis on every incoming request.

### 5.2 Rate Limiting
Configured in `backend/src/middleware/rateLimiter.middleware.js`:
- Standard API rate limiting via `express-rate-limit` with Redis store backend.
- Prevents denial-of-service attempts and credential stuffing on authentication endpoints.

### 5.3 Authentication & Authorization
- Double-token architecture: Short-lived JWT Access Tokens (15 minutes, httpOnly cookie) and long-lived Refresh Tokens (7 days).
- Google OAuth2 integration with automatic account provisioning.
- Role-based route guards (`user`, `contractor`, `admin`, `owner`).

### 5.4 Database Failover
Configured in `backend/src/config/db.js`:
- Primary connection attempts `MONGO_URI`.
- If the primary cluster becomes unreachable, the connection automatically falls back to `SECONDARY_MONGO_URI` without crashing the application.

## 6. AI CONTRACTOR INTELLIGENCE & TENDER ANALYSIS ENGINE

### 6.1 What Has Been Completed

The AI subsystem is located in:
- `backend/src/services/contractorAgent.service.js`
- `backend/src/models/TenderAiDossier.js`
- `backend/src/models/ContractorAgentProfile.js`
- `backend/src/models/AiAgentChatSession.js`
- `backend/src/controllers/services.controller.js`
- `backend/src/routes/services.routes.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/Services.jsx`

#### Accomplishments:
1. Complete Schema Design: Full data models for `TenderAiDossier` (pre-bid analysis, material BOQ breakdown, post-award milestones, risk flags) and `ContractorAgentProfile` (turnover, solvency, equipment inventory, credit quotas).
2. Multi-Tiered AI Execution Engine:
   - Primary: Google Gemini client initialized via `@google/generative-ai` (`gemini-1.5-flash`).
   - Secondary: OpenAI client initialized via `openai` (`gpt-4o-mini`).
   - Tertiary Deterministic Engine: `generateDeterministicEngineeringDossier()`. A rule-based civil engineering estimation algorithm that generates structured BOQs, material schedules, and risk flags even when external AI API keys are missing or rate-limited.
3. Copilot Chat Endpoint: `/api/v1/services/chat/:tenderId` maintaining session history in `AiAgentChatSession`.
4. Front-End Interface: Production-ready UI in `Services.jsx` with tabbed views (Executive Brief, Eligibility, Materials & BOQ, Milestones & Safety, Copilot Chat).

---

### 6.2 Current Limitations & Missing Components

To enable full production AI capabilities, the incoming developer must address the following three items:

1. Missing Live Gemini API Key:
   - In `backend/.env`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` is currently unset or contains a placeholder.
   - Without a valid key, the service falls back to the deterministic estimation engine. While the deterministic engine produces realistic estimates, it cannot extract nuanced text from unstandardized tender specifications.

2. Document Ingestion Pipeline for Full NIT PDFs:
   - Currently, `executeGeminiTenderAnalysis()` passes metadata fields (`title`, `department`, `estimatedValue`, `workDescription`, `coversInfo`) into the LLM context.
   - The actual downloaded PDF text stored in Cloudflare R2 is not yet being piped into the prompt.
   - For complex tenders where qualification criteria are hidden within 50-page PDF clauses, the text extracted by `pdf-parse` needs to be passed to Gemini Flash using context caching or a chunked embedding search.

3. BOQ Item Rate Customization:
   - BOQ material rates (cement, steel, bitumen) are currently based on regional schedule-of-rates (SoR) estimates. The ability for contractors to override material base prices and recalculate margins in real-time is not yet wired to a backend persistence endpoint.

The incoming developer should follow this sequence to finalize the AI engine:

#### Phase 1: Activate Live Gemini API Key & Validate Live LLM Path (1 Day)
1. Obtain an API key from Google AI Studio (`aistudio.google.com`).
2. Add the key to `backend/.env`:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your_actual_key...
   GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
   ```
3. Restart the backend and run an analysis via `POST /api/v1/services/analyze/:tenderId`.
4. Verify in `backend/src/services/contractorAgent.service.js` that `dossier.aiEngine.model` saves as `gemini-1.5-flash` rather than `deterministic-rules-engine`.

#### Phase 2: Connect Cloudflare R2 PDF Text Ingestion (2-3 Days)
1. In `backend/src/services/contractorAgent.service.js`, check if `tender.nitDocumentUrl` or `tender.documents` contains an S3 key.
2. If present, stream the file from Cloudflare R2 via `backend/src/config/r2.js` using `GetObjectCommand`.
3. Pass the buffer to `pdf-parse` to extract raw text (limit to the first 40 pages or 100,000 tokens).
4. Supply this extracted text to Gemini's prompt:
   ```javascript
   const pdfText = await this.extractTextFromR2Document(tender.nitDocumentKey);
   const prompt = `Here is the full text of the tender specification:\n${pdfText}\n\nAnalyze and extract...`;
   ```
5. Utilize Gemini 1.5 Flash's large context window (up to 1,000,000 tokens) which easily accommodates full 100-page tender documents without needing vector chunking.

#### Phase 3: Implement Context Caching for Cost Optimization (1 Day)
1. Since multiple contractors may analyze the same high-value tender, cache the ingested tender document using the Gemini Context Caching API.
2. Store the `cacheName` on `TenderAiDossier`. Subsequent queries (or Copilot chat questions) will incur 75% lower token fees and run with lower latency.

#### Phase 4: Frontend BOQ Rate Override & Excel Export (2 Days)
1. In `frontend/src/pages/Services.jsx`, add an edit mode to the Materials & BOQ table allowing the contractor to update market rates (e.g. changing Cement from ₹380 to ₹360).
2. Implement client-side export to Excel (.xlsx) using the existing `jszip` / spreadsheet utility so contractors can submit their price bids directly.

| **AI LLM API** | Google Gemini (Gemini 1.5 Flash) | Tender summarization, BOQ extraction, Copilot chat | ~$5.00 - $15.00 | ₹420 - ₹1,250 |
| **Payment Gateway** | Razorpay Standard (Pay-per-transaction) | 2% per successful transaction (deducted from revenue) | No fixed fee | 2% of GMV |
| **Disaster Recovery** | Telegram Bot API | Automated database snapshot notifications and off-site backup | $0.00 (Free) | ₹0 |
| **TOTAL ESTIMATED MONTHLY COST** | — | — | **~$30.00 - $95.00** | **₹2,500 - ₹8,000** |

### Recommendations for Cost Efficiency:
1. Cloudflare R2 provides zero egress fees, saving significant bandwidth costs compared to AWS S3 when contractors download 20 MB tender drawings.
2. Gemini 1.5 Flash is priced at $0.075 per 1M input tokens, making each full 50-page tender dossier analysis cost less than ₹0.50 (50 paise), preserving healthy profit margins on the ₹999/month subscription.

## 9. CRITICAL GOTCHAS, KNOWN EDGE CASES, & DEVELOPER FAQS

### Q1: The crawler stalls or throws timeout errors during portal scraping. Why?
Government ASP.NET portals often undergo maintenance late at night or throttle connections after frequent rapid queries.
- Ensure `SCRAPER_HEADLESS=true` in production.
- If scraping locally from an IP with frequent CAPTCHAs, verify `CAPSOLVER_API_KEY` has active balance.
- Check `backend/src/services/JKTenderAdapter.js` to ensure the table selector matches any recent portal UI modifications.

### Q2: Why are Razorpay payments marked successful in the Razorpay dashboard, but the user is not activated in the database?
This happens if the user closes their browser window immediately upon completing payment before the client-side redirect completes.
- Verify that the Razorpay Webhook is active in the Razorpay dashboard pointing to:
  `https://tenderhub-backend-jofq.onrender.com/api/v1/billing/webhook`
- Ensure `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches between Render environment variables and the Razorpay Webhook settings.
- The webhook listener will automatically process `payment.captured` and activate the subscription independently of the browser.

### Q3: Why does `express.json()` use a custom `verify` function in `backend/src/app.js`?
Razorpay webhook signature verification requires computing an HMAC-SHA256 signature against the raw, unparsed request payload buffer. The custom verify function attaches `req.rawBody = buf`, ensuring cryptographic verification succeeds without formatting mismatches.

### Q4: How are AI credits tracked and prevented from being abused?
Credits are stored on the `ContractorAgentProfile` model in the `credits` object:
- `availableDossiers`: Decremented by 1 every time a new tender is analyzed.
- Completed dossiers are cached globally in `TenderAiDossier`. If Contractor B requests an analysis for a tender that Contractor A already analyzed, the cached dossier is served immediately, and personalized fit calculations are performed locally without consuming additional LLM tokens.
